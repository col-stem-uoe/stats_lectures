# Course Overview

-   Research design and data\
-   Describing categorical data\
-   Describing continuous data\
-   Describing relationships\
-   Functions\
-   Hypothesis testing and inference

## Week’s Learning Objectives

1.  Understand the link between **study design** and **data**.\
2.  Define and distinguish between **levels of measurement**.\
3.  Identify and describe **data types** with applied examples.

## Topics for Today

-   Broad aim of measurement\
-   Measurement, design, and data\
-   Data in R

## Concepts in Measurement

Measurement links research design to the kind of data collected.\
Understanding how variables are measured determines the type of analysis you can use.

## Data Types and Levels

### **Categorical**

-   Nominal

-   Ordinal

-   Binary (special case)

## Categorical Data: Example

-   Variables with a discrete number of response options.

-   Often coded as integers.

-   Binary data is a special case with only two possible values.

## Levels of Measurement

1.  **Nominal** – categories without order\
2.  **Ordinal** – ordered categories\
3.  **Interval** – ordered, equal spacing, no true zero\
4.  **Ratio** – ordered, equal spacing, true zero

With each level, numeric values gain meaning and allow more analytical options.

## 1. Nominal Data

Categorical variables where numeric or text labels have **no meaningful order**.\
Examples include demographic variables or yes/no responses.

::: autoscale-table
| ID   | Gender     | Exercise |
|:-----|:-----------|:---------|
| S001 | Female     | Yes      |
| S002 | Male       | No       |
| S003 | Female     | Yes      |
| S004 | Male       | No       |
| S005 | Non-binary | No       |
:::

## 2. Ordinal Data

Categorical variables with a **meaningful rank order**,\
but where the difference between categories is **not numerically equal**.

::: autoscale-table
| ID   | Stress_level | Satisfaction_Likert_item | Satisfaction_Likert_value |
|:-----|:-------------|:-------------------------|--------------------------:|
| S001 | Moderate     | Satisfied                |                         4 |
| S002 | High         | Dissatisfied             |                         2 |
| S003 | Low          | Very Satisfied           |                         5 |
| S004 | Moderate     | Satisfied                |                         4 |
| S005 | High         | Dissatisfied             |                         2 |
:::

## 2. Ordinal Data

Categorical variables with a **meaningful rank order**,\
but where the difference between categories is **not numerically equal**.

::: autoscale-table
| ID   | Stress_level | Satisfaction_Likert_item | Satisfaction_Likert_value |
|:-----|:-------------|:-------------------------|:--------------------------|
| S001 | Moderate     | Satisfied                | 4                         |
| S002 | High         | Dissatisfied             | 2                         |
| S003 | Low          | Very Satisfied           | 5                         |
| S004 | Moderate     | Satisfied                | 4                         |
| S005 | High         | Dissatisfied             | 2                         |
:::

<br>

::: note
-   The categories follow a logical order (e.g., Low → Moderate → High; Very Dissatisfied → Very Satisfied).

-   The numeric codes (1–5) represent ranking, but not equal intervals between points — e.g., the “distance” between Satisfied and Very Satisfied is not necessarily the same as between Neutral and Satisfied.
:::

## 3. Interval Data

:::::: columns
::: column
-   Numerical values have **meaning**
-   **No true zero point**
-   Differences between values are **meaningful**
:::

:::: column
::: example-box
Example: **IQ** or other **standardised test scores**

IQ is a good example of **interval data** — the difference between 100 and 110 is the same as between 110 and 120, but there is no true zero point that indicates “no intelligence”.
:::
::::
::::::

::: autoscale-table
| ID   | Gender     | IQ  |
|:-----|:-----------|:----|
| S001 | Female     | 102 |
| S004 | Male       | 110 |
| S008 | Female     | 120 |
| S015 | Female     | 115 |
| S018 | Male       | 90  |
| S030 | Non-binary | 96  |
:::

::: small-note
> **Note:** Interval data are often used for psychological or educational scores, where differences are meaningful but ratios (e.g. “twice as intelligent”) are not.
:::

## 4. Ratio Data {.tight}

:::::: columns
::: column
-   Numerical values have **meaning**
-   Contain a **true zero point**
-   Possible to **multiply and divide**
:::

:::: column
::: example-box
Examples from this dataset:

**Study_hours** — 0 means no study time\
**Sleep_hours** — 0 means no sleep\
**Overall_mark** — 0 indicates no marks earned

::: autoscale-table
| ID   | Study_hours | Sleep_hours | Overall_mark |
|:-----|:------------|:------------|:-------------|
| S001 | 6.8         | 7.4         | 68           |
| S007 | 2.7         | 5.0         | 49           |
| S015 | 8.5         | 7.9         | 79           |
| S021 | 8.1         | 7.6         | 77           |
| S027 | 9.1         | 8.3         | 82           |
:::

::: small-note
> **Note:** Ratio data have all the properties of interval data but include a meaningful zero, allowing for statements such as “studied twice as many hours”.

| **R Data Type** | **Example (from dataset)** | **Level of Measurement** | **Data Type** |
|:-----------------|:------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| Character | ID | Nominal | (Categorical) |

## Data sets

![](images/data_set.png){width="483"}

## Tidy Data

![](images/clipboard-1407511003.png){width="528"}

1.  Each **variable** has its own **column**.\
2.  Each **observation** has its own **row**.\
3.  Each **value** has its own **cell**.

Each value belongs simultaneously to a variable and an observation.

# Working with Data in R

Typical workflow:

-   Import datasets into R (`read.csv()` or `read_tsv()`)\
-   Check variable types (`str()` or `glimpse()`)\
-   Select columns and filter rows (`dplyr`)\
-   Recode or create variables\
-   Merge data sets\
-   Summarise and visualise

# Summary of Today

-   Connection between **research design** and **data**\
-   Key **types and levels** of data\
-   Representation of data types in **R**\
-   Introduction to **tidy data** principles


# What Happens Next After Today

Today we introduced:

- how constructs become measurable variables  
- types of variables and levels of measurement  
- tidy data and how datasets are structured  
- how R represents and stores data  

After this lecture:

- use the **Week 08 online notes** to review today’s concepts  
- complete the **variable classification exercise**  
- identify **independent** and **dependent** variables (IVs and DVs) in the dataset you will use  

In next week’s session (Week 09), we will begin:

- describing **categorical data**  
- working with **frequencies**, **percentages**, and **bar plots**  
- using R to summarise **categorical variables**
