## 

## Learning objectives

1\. Interpret a confidence interval as the plausible values of a parameter that would not be rejected in a two-sided hypothesis test.

2\. Determine the decision for a two-sided hypothesis test from an appropriately constructed confidence interval.

3\. Be able to explain the dierence between a significant result and an important result.

Introduction

## What we have learned so far?

-   how to describe a variable (centre + spread),

-   how distributions behave (skew, kurtosis),

-   how sample statistics can vary from sample to sample,

-   how a sample mean is only an *estimate* of a population mean.

**If a sample mean is only an estimate, how do we decide whether a result is “real” or just due to chance?**

## Population vs Sample

We performed a study by selecting a **sample from the population**.

The goal is to use the **sample data** to answer questions about the population data. For example

-   What's the population mean? **Goal A**: estimating a parameter.

-   Could the population mean be zero? **Goal B**: testing a theory (hypothesis) about a parameter.

Hypothesis Testing & Confidence Intervals

## Why test hypotheses?

-   In research we rarely observe an entire population.\
-   We collect a **sample**, which varies naturally from sample to sample.\
-   Hypothesis testing helps us answer questions such as:
    -   *“Is this difference likely to be real?”*\
    -   *“Or could it have happened just by chance?”*

## Why test hypotheses?

Many questions in psychology ask whether an observed difference could simply be due to **chance variation**.

-   Example: A group of students has an average score of 68.\
    But is this *really* different from the national average of 65?

-   Or was our sample simply a little higher *by chance*?

To answer this, we need a **formal framework** for deciding whether the difference in our sample is large enough to conclude a real effect.

→ This is what **hypothesis testing** provides.

## At the heart of hypothesis testing are two competing ideas:

::::: columns
::: column
-   **Null hypothesis (H₀):**\
    “Nothing is going on.”\
    There is *no real difference*. Any difference is just sampling variability.

    -   Example:
        -   H₀: The average exam mark this year = last year.
:::

::: column
-   **Alternative hypothesis (H₁):**\
    “Something is going on.”\
    There **is** a real difference in the population.

    -   Example:
        -   H₁: The average exam mark this year ≠ last year.
:::
:::::

Example:\
H₀: μ = 65\
H₁: μ ≠ 65

We collect data to see which hypothesis is more consistent with our sample.

## Sampling variation

-   Every sample gives a slightly different mean.\
-   If we repeatedly sampled from the same population, we would get a **sampling distribution** of sample means.\
-   Most sample means will be near the true population mean.\
-   Extreme sample means are possible, but **unlikely**.

## The t-test 

-   A t-test asks: *How far is our sample mean from what H₀ predicts?*
-   We measure this in **standard errors**.\
-   If the difference is:
    -   **Small** → fits comfortably within what we expect from chance variation.

    -   **Large** → unlikely to be due to chance alone.
-   The t-test standardises this difference by:
    -   The standard deviation
    -   The sample size

Result: a **t-value** telling us how unusual our sample is under H₀.

## What is a p-value?

### A visual idea (no maths needed):

-   Imagine the sampling distribution **if H₀ were true**.
-   The p-value tells us:

> **How likely is it to get a result as extreme as ours if the null hypothesis were true?**

-   **Small p-value** → our data are unlikely under H₀ → evidence *against* H₀.
-   **Large p-value** → our data are plausible under H₀ → *keep* H₀.

## Interpreting p-values

-   p \< 0.05 is a common rule of thumb for “statistical significance”.
    -   Means the result is unlikely to have occurred purely by chance.\
-   But remember:
    -   p-values **do not** tell us the size of the effect.
    -   p-values **do not** tell us how important a result is.
    -   p-values **do not** tell us the probability that H₀ is true.

## Confidence interval = range of plausible values

-   A CI gives a range of population means consistent with our sample.
-   If the hypothesised value lies **inside** the CI → plausible → do not reject H₀.
-   If it lies **outside** the CI → implausible → reject H₀.

## Confidence intervals = range of plausible values

-   A **95% confidence interval (CI)** gives a range of values that are **compatible with the data**.\

-   Not: “There is a 95% chance the true value is inside the interval.”\

-   Instead:\
    \> If we repeated the study many times, 95% of the calculated intervals would contain the true value.

-   Practical interpretation:\
    \> “These are the values that make sense, given our data.”

## CI and significance

-   If a **95% CI for a mean difference *does not include 0*** → the difference is “statistically significant”.\
-   Because 0 (no difference) is *not plausible*.\
-   If the CI *does include* 0 → we do not have evidence of a real difference.

This matches the p-value rule: - CI excludes 0 ↔ p \< 0.05\
- CI includes 0 ↔ p ≥ 0.05

## Example conclusion (in words)

> “The treatment group scored higher on average than the control group.\
> The difference was statistically significant (t = …, p = …).\
> The 95% confidence interval for the difference did not include zero, suggesting a real difference in the population.”

-   Clear
-   Non-technical
-   Answers: *What does this result actually mean?*

## Summary

-   Hypothesis tests help us judge whether differences are likely to reflect real effects rather than chance.\
-   p-values tell us how unusual the data are if H₀ were true.\
-   CIs give a range of plausible values.\
-   t-tests compare means by combining:
    -   difference in means
    -   sample size
    -   variability (SD)
