The left panel shows a slightly rising red line drawn through the middle of the panel, passing near a few dots but not obviously related to most of them. A red text is below the dots: R-squared = 0.06. The right panel shows many of the dots connected by red lines to form a stick figure of a man resembling the constellation Orion, with the hand on the reader's right raised and holding an object. A red text is below the dots: Rexthor, the Dog-Bearer. A caption is below and spanning both panels: I don't trust linear regressions when it's harder to guess the direction of the correlation from the scatter plot than to find new constellations on it."

## Example of Maths and Plot

Given response $y$ and **single** predictor $x$, this model fits to the equation

\begin{equation}
  y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x.
\end{equation}

Visually, the line of best fit from linear regression may look like the below.

    x = "horsepower, x",
    y = "miles per gallon, y",
  ) +
  ylim(0, 35)
